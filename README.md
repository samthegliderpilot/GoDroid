# GoDroid
## Fork of the original GOdroid by Andreas Grothe 

The game of Go is one of my favorites.  I love being able to just play a game on my phone, but the classic GOdroid, after 12 years, is no longer supported.  So I updated it

Fixing all of the deprecate API calls, recompiling GnuGo, fixing various odds and ends, and even adding a few new features.  It is now ready for the next decade.
